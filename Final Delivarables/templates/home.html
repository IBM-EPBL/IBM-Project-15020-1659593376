            <p class="par">Providing excellent customer care can separate you from the competition. It's more commonplace to provide great customer service, but customer care comes with time, effort and an earnest interest in building a relationship. Customers should be able to see the value your business provides if customer care is a focus.
           <br> A successful business will work on both customer care and customer service, making each a focus to form a mutually beneficial relationship with the customer that can satisfy their needs and increase sales and brand awareness for the business</p>
